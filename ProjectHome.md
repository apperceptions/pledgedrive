The Pledge Drive Word Press Plug-in allows bloggers to facilitate the support of projects through Paypal contributions.  Once installed, the plug-in allows any blog post to define a project where Paypal contributions are solicited for a specific goal, amount and time period.  If the goal is reached, payment is made to a project specific Paypal business or premium account.

Site visitors may contribute through an enhanced commenting mechanism that allows for optional Paypal contributions.  Contributions can be anonymous or added with a name and link to a site of their choosing.  The amount can be hidden (but sometimes inferred).

The plug-in is licensed as GNU General Public License.
